Overview:
This project is an open-source, dynamic web form application inspired by popular platforms like Google Forms, but with enhanced features for security, customization, and data analysis. It is designed to collect user information securely, store the data, and provide real-time analytics and sorting options.

Key Features:
Dark Mode with Theme Switcher: The website has a sleek, modern dark mode with a hacker terminal aesthetic using Cascadia font and green text. Users can switch to a light mode with a white background and black text for a simpler interface.
Interactive Form Fields: The form includes fields for entering:
Name (required)
Email ID (required)
Contact Details
Social Links
Drive Link for Achievements and Certificates
Glow Effect on Hover: Form fields glow slightly when hovered over, enhancing the interactive user experience.
Analytics Dashboard: A button at the top right of the webpage provides a real-time analytics dashboard showing:
Number of form views
Submission rates
Pie chart or bar graph to analyze user preferences based on submitted data
Advanced Sorting Options: An additional feature allows sorting of form data by:
Alphabetical order (Name)
Age group
Hobbies
Club
Data Privacy and Access Control:
Only the form owner (you) has access to the submitted data.
If anyone else tries to access the data, they will see a locked icon.
Responsive Design: Built using the W3.CSS framework, the website is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.
Real-Time Updates: Both the analytics dashboard and sorting feature pages are updated in real-time as users submit the form.
Submission Restrictions: Pasting answers is disabled, requiring users to manually type their responses.
Terms and Conditions: Users must agree to the terms and conditions, with a tick box to ensure compliance. A link to the terms explains:
How email information is used (e.g., for newsletters)
The voluntary nature of sharing additional information
Thank You Message
Upon successful submission, users will be greeted with a personalized thank-you message, e.g., “Greetings, @name! We want to thank you for your valuable feedback.”

Use Cases:
College Event Management: This platform is perfect for collecting participant information for college events, allowing organizers to track submissions and understand user preferences.
Secure Data Collection: Designed with encryption in mind, the platform ensures that sensitive data (e.g., contact details, certificates) is stored securely.
Real-Time Feedback Analysis: The analytics dashboard provides real-time insights into user behavior and preferences, helping event organizers or website owners make informed decisions.
User Sorting and Segmentation: The advanced sorting feature is ideal for segmenting users into different categories, making it easy to manage participants by their interests or group affiliation.
